# IN-VEHICLE-COUPON-RECOMENDATION
Provide insights with tableau dashboard as recommendation to enhance coupon acceptance and generate predictive model using supervised learning method
## **In Vehicle Coupon Recommendation**

We are a team of 7 who worked on Final Project of Rakamin Data Science Bootcamp to build a classification model for our dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/invehicle-coupon-recommendation). Our main goal is to build a model to enhance coupon acceptance rate by using the classification model we generated and as well as provide insights as recommendation to increase coupon acceptance rate. Our work was divided to 4 stages that summarized as below:

### **Stage 0**
In this stage we defined our problem statement, goal, objective and business metrics of our project.

### **Stage 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis**
We focused on gathering insights from statistical views.

What we have done on this stage:

- Descriptive Analysis
- Univariate Analysis
- Business Insight As Business Recommendation

### **Stage 2 - Preprocessing date**
We did manipulation on data before it is used in order to build the model.

What we have done on this stage:

- Handle Missing Values
- Handle Duplicated Data
- Feature Transformation
- Feature Encoding
- Feature Selection
- Feature Extraction

### **Stage 3 - Modeling and Evaluation**
We tested our data train to machine learning model and evaluated it. On this stage we created 7 different preprocessing treatment on datasets. We tested it to 5 different models: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost and CatBoost.  Each 7 of us did different preprocessing process so we know which preprocessing data is better at the model we tested.

What we have done on this stage:

- Preprocessing Data
- Splitting Data (Data Train and Data Test)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Testing
- Tuning Hyperparameters and feature selection
- Model Selection

### **Stage 4  - Final Presentation**
Based on our result, out best model is CatBoost with accuracy score 77% and precision score 77%. Our model performance could increase coupon acceptance rate as well as increase B/C ratio by 0.61x (from 1.7x to 2.31x).
